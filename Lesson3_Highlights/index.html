            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is a way to efficiently maintain file editions.
                he practice is useful because it allows users to gain access to multiple versions of a project without
                creating endless copies. 
                This works in such a way that it records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall older versions when needed.  
                It allows you to bring a workspace back to a specific state, convert the whole project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see all users on the project, 
                and who introduced an issue. 
                Version control also serves as a back-up method for projects, as it allows users to recover their work if lost locally. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems exist in many forms. 
            The most common version-control method is to copy files into another directory. 
            This approach is a very simple approach to managing files. 
            However it is easy to lose which directory a file resides in, accidentally write to the wrong file and/or copy over a version of a file you were trying to preserve. 
            Programmers over time created a system where all the changes to files were under revision control.
            To handle the issue of developers needing to collaborate with each other through separate systems, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. 
            The method to this system is having one server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. This has been the established standard for version control. 
            A major issue with this design however, is a risk of single point failure.
            Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) are a direct answer to single point failure concerns. DVCSs fully mirror the repository and its full history. 
            If there is any failure with the servers any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. 
            Every user’s local system is a full backup of all the data.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has a very interesting background story. 
            The origins of this DCVS start with the Linux kernel project. 
            The project relied on archived files and patches for the better part of its lifetime. 
            Surely as the project grew in size the efficiency of this system started to deteriorate. 
            In 2002, the community started using a DVCS called BitKeeper. 
            Due to conflict between the project community and the company of BitKeeper, the free-of-charge status was revoked for using the VCS. 
            In response to this the Linux community decided to create their own DCVS with particular goals. 
            The tool was to prioritize speed, simplicity of design, non-linear support, full distribution, and management of large projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Understanding Git’s fundamentals and philosophy is integral to efficiently using the tool. 
            Git thinks of data as a series of snapshots. 
            The program takes a picture of how all files look at the moment of a commit or save. 
            Most of Git’s operations take place locally, allowing offline use.
            At the very base of Git’s functionality is integration. 
            Information cannot be lost in transit or files cannot become corrupted without the system being alerted to it. 
            Fear of accidentally erasing data is quelled as Git only adds data. 
            Git has three states that files can reside in. These include committed, modified, and staged.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A Git project has 3 main stages the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area.
The Git directory stores all your metadata and is an object database for your project. 
This is fundamental to Git’s success and is what is copied to your local repository.
The working tree is a checkpoint for the relevant version of the project. 
These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit. 
The workflow of Git goes such as: modifying files in your working tree, staging files for the next commit (adding only those files), 
and committing (which takes the files and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory).
